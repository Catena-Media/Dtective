* [Java JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)
* [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) is not essential, yet recommended since
 it provides a lot of great plugins and code completion (intellisense) for BDD steps
* [Chrome](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) drivers that should be copied to the root folder of the project
* If you use another editor that is not IntelliJ please install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* To use the provided docker related files please consider to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce) according to your OS
