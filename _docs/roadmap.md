We are now on the BETA phase of the project. We have been working with Dtetive for years and it is now your turn to give us feedback.
We want to involve you right from the start, so make sure you [join our community](https://gitter.im/Dtective/community)
in Gitter and you share your thoughts - we really appreciate them!  üôè

We have now released our roadmap, available in a [JIRA board format](https://dtective.atlassian.net/) ! Check out what we are up to and any feedback on Gitter is welcomed.

__Note:__ We are establishing the board only for following up progress on __features/refactoring/significant improvements__.
Bug related follow ups are done in the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Catena-Media/Dtective/issues). We are accepting Feature requests in the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Catena-Media/Dtective/issues) as well.

*JIRA is not allowing completely public boards anymore, even for open source projects, so creating an account is necessary for security reasons.*
