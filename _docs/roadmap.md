We are now on the BETA phase of the project. We have been working with Dtetive for years and it is now your turn to give us feedback.
We want to involve you right from the start, so make sure you [join our community](https://gitter.im/Dtective/community)
in Gitter and you share your thoughts - we really appreciate them!  

We have now released our roadmap, available in a [Trello board format](https://trello.com/b/XujHzvN6)! Check out what we are up to  🙏

__Note:__ We are establishing the board only for following up progress on features and other improvements.
Bug related follow ups and feature requests are still done in the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Catena-Media/Dtective/issues).

🦄 *We will be moving towards a more community interactive Roadmap, but we will have to complete some migrations to achieve so. It will be coming soon!* 🦄
