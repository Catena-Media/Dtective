Get the boilerplate to start writing tests as fast as possible, by [forking](https://jira.catena.media/browse/SA-9328)
the Dtective-boilerplate repository.



Keep the boilerplate updated with the **Dtective** latest changes by bumping the version in the `pom.xml`.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>catena.qa</groupId>
    <artifactId>TestAutomationEngineAllInOne</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.6</version>
</dependency>
```
