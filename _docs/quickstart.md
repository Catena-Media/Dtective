Please [clone](https://github.com/Catena-Media/Dtective-boilerplate) the boilerplate code necessary to start writing tests as fast as possible.

Also take a look at the [cheatsheet](https://catena-media.github.io/Dtective/docs/cheatsheet/) to start writing tests right away.

**Important**: The drivers are missing from the boilerplate. Please download them and add them to the project root.
Check the [installation](https://catena-media.github.io/Dtective/docs/installation/) instructions to find links for the drivers.


Keep the boilerplate updated with  **Dtective** latest changes by bumping the version in the `pom.xml`.

```java
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.dtective</groupId>
    <artifactId>dtective-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
