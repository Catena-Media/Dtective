## [1.2] - 2019-02-18
### Added

- JsonPath (JsonPath) implementation for all the steps which interact with JSON Object keys and values. Example:

    - Then I assert that value from key "sum" stored in local param is greater than "30"

        - In this case, the 'sum' key is expected to be at the root level of the JSON Object, same as value would be set to "$.sum"

- Added new steps: 
    - Then value of local param "param" is equal to "something"
    - And I add key "id" and value "123" in JSON path "$" for JSON from data store "JSONbody" and store it in data store "newJSON"
    - And I get value of key "$.newKey" from JSON in local param "jsonObject" and store it in local param "value1"
